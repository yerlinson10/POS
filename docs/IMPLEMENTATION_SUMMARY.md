# ‚úÖ Widgets Implementation Summary

## üîß Scroll Issues Fixed

### Problem Identified
- Widget card borders were disappearing during scroll
- CSS transforms were breaking element positioning
- Overflow settings were preventing proper scrolling

### Solution Applied
1. **Removed problematic CSS transforms**:
   - `transform: translateZ(0)` - REMOVED
   - `will-change: transform` - REMOVED  
   - `backface-visibility: hidden` - REMOVED

2. **Improved overflow handling**:
   - Changed from `overflow: hidden` to `overflow: visible` on widget containers
   - Added `overflow: auto` on card content areas
   - Added `min-height: 0` for proper flex overflow

3. **Enhanced positioning**:
   - Used clean absolute positioning without transforms
   - Added proper containment with `contain: layout style`
   - Improved spacing with calculated margins

4. **Better responsive design**:
